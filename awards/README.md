# Confirmed awards

For [MathDB pilot problems](../problems/mathdb-pilot.md), use the
[new confirmation and payment rules](../docs/award-process-mathdb.md#5-announcement-and-payment)
and the [pilot rows below](#mathdb-pilot-awards). Preserve the existing award
register and historical decisions. The legacy process described below applies
to legacy records; no historical reward is automatically recalculated.

Only confirmed, publicly announced awards belong here.
Follow the [confirmation and delivery process](../docs/award-process.md#step-3-recipient-confirmation-and-award-delivery)
before publishing an award.

Record each awarded contribution in English Markdown, identifying the JSP
problem, contribution type, recipients, announcement link,
completed public-review dates and supporting evidence. Mathematical solution and
Lean formalization contributions are recorded separately. Update the candidate
register for the awarded contribution. Keep that role's claim status **Claimed**
in the problem index after it moves from `candidates/` to
`awards/`, even when its candidate entry is removed.

See the [record guide](../docs/records.md) and optional [Markdown templates](../docs/templates/).

## Award register

The following contributions were moved from the candidate register on 2026-10-03
at the maintainer's direction, treating their public-review periods as complete.
Review dates retain the date-only UTC precision of the original candidate records.
Problem links provide the recorded contribution attribution and proof evidence.

### MathDB pilot awards

Publish a category only after the team's qualification, identity and personal
written confirmations, 14-day public review, resolved material objections and
applicable payment conditions are complete. Solution also requires current
complete Lean verification or MathDB's explicit adoption of external evidence.
The formalizer's own award is not a prerequisite. Retain fixed versions, evidence,
claim and candidate-history links; the register records no levels or estimates.

No MathDB pilot awards have been announced yet.

| Problem ID | Category | Confirmed recipients | Rules version | MathDB / fixed evidence | Claim issue | Completed public review (UTC start/end) | Announcement and retained candidate history | Payment status and team confirmation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Distinguish `Announced / awaiting payment` from `Paid`; the latter requires the
team's confirmed payment result, without publishing private payment details.
Closing an issue, elapsed notice or an agent notification is not payment evidence.
The team retains any later correction/revocation and its evidence in the history.

Use category `Solution`, `Lean` or `Exposition`. After updating these rows and the
candidate table, run `python3 scripts/mathdb_pilot.py build` and commit the generated
index/pilot page. The category's `Awarded` registration state reports this announced
record; the detailed record controls any later correction/revocation and whether
payment has been confirmed.
