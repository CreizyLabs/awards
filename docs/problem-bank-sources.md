# Problem bank sources

[Problem bank](../problems/README.md) · [Repository home](../README.md)

The problem bank is compiled from publicly documented mathematical problems and research literature. Its sources include public problem collections, academic papers and monographs, research updates, and formal proof repositories. The project organizes these materials into a common catalog, using JSP identifiers to connect problem statements, known results, references, and subsequent updates.

The [disclaimer and correction process](../problems/README.md#disclaimer-and-corrections) applies to all information in the problem bank.

## Source materials

Different sources serve different purposes:

- **Problem collections and reference literature** help identify problems, trace their background, and connect related formulations.
- **Original papers and monographs** provide statements, historical context, and mathematical results.
- **Solution papers, preprints, public research announcements, and discussions** provide evidence of complete solutions and their attribution. Their publication and review status should be read as stated in each record.
- **Public formal proof repositories and accompanying documentation** provide evidence about formalization, the statement covered by a proof, and the contributors involved.

References and links in individual entries preserve the connection to these sources. A source used to locate a problem does not necessarily establish its earliest formulation, a complete solution, or the attribution of every contribution.

## Catalog organization

The catalog uses consistent identifiers and fields to organize problem descriptions, proposed dates, mathematical areas, current status, formal proof evidence, historical bounties, and publication details. References connect entries to the underlying literature and proof records.

Duplicate records may be consolidated, with relevant formulations retained. Special cases, different dimensions, and generalizations require explicit scope: a result for one case does not establish a result for the entire problem. Uncertain dates, incomplete evidence, and unresolved attribution are qualified in the entries and review notes.

JSP identifiers are catalog references. They do not establish original authorship, a difficulty ranking, or an award level. Credit for posing a problem, solving it, and formalizing a proof follows the corresponding sources and contribution records.

## Coverage and award status

The [49-problem MathDB pilot](../problems/mathdb-pilot.md) adds 28 new
problems while retaining 21 existing JSP records. It uses the
[new MathDB process](award-process-mathdb.md), with category-specific qualification
and claim records. A MathDB mapping identifies the problem; it does not verify a
solution or establish entitlement. The shared legacy eligibility convention below
continues for problems outside the pilot.

The catalog covers areas including number theory, combinatorics, graph theory, analysis, geometry, and algebra. The index and detail tables use **Current status** with **Open** or **Solved**. Partial results and incomplete Lean formalizations are not recorded; problems without a complete solution remain **Open**. Solved entries retain complete-solution evidence and contributor credits, with mathematical solver credits included in the **Current status** field.

The catalog includes all seven Millennium Prize Problems (JSP-000001 through JSP-000007): the Riemann hypothesis, P versus NP, the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, the Hodge conjecture, Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness, Yang–Mills existence and mass gap, and the Poincaré conjecture.

Records can include human contributions and AI-assisted work where supported by public evidence. AI involvement is recorded as part of the contribution history; it does not define the source of the problem bank.

Inclusion in the catalog is separate from award approval. Each entry has a shared **Eligible to claim** field requiring both a mathematical solution and a Lean proof. The index also displays separate **Solver claim status** and **Lean claim status** fields for candidate registration and confirmed awards. See the [reading conventions](../problems/README.md#reading-conventions). Formal candidates and announced awards have separate records and review requirements.

## Tracing a particular problem

Find the JSP identifier in the [problem index](../problems/README.md), then follow its entry to the problem description, publication details, proof links, and review notes. Some references are bibliographic records rather than direct links to a paper; the entry identifies that distinction.

Where present, **Attribution basis** provides **Solver attribution source** and **Lean attribution source** links for the displayed contributors. The [attribution conventions](../problems/README.md#attribution-conventions) explain the short labels and the scope of these credits.

Corrections and additional sources can be submitted through the process in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md). Include the JSP identifier and supporting public references so that the proposed correction can be checked against the problem's scope and existing evidence.
